Each student will be expected to think about all the questions from the [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) section and to write out an answer to one of the assigned questions for that week. Frame your answer in terms suggested by the readings for that week. Please type your thoughts out on one page and bring enough copies for everyone in class. Put the week and question at the top of the page.

In addition, students will be expected to write a 15-20 page research paper on a subject approved early in the semester by either Prof. Perry or Prof. Tick. These papers should extend and deepen the investigations of the course. Grades will be based on the quality of this written work as well as on participation in class discussion.
